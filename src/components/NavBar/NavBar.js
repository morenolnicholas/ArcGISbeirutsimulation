                    "On 4 August 2020, a large amount of ammonium nitrate stored at the port of the city of Beirut,
                    the capital of Lebanon, exploded, causing at least 200 deaths, 3 reported missing, 6,500 injuries,
                    US$10â€“15 billion in property damage, and leaving an estimated 300,000 people homeless.[1][2] Around 2,750 tonnes of
                    the substance (equivalent to around 1.1 kilotons of TNT) had been stored in a warehouse without proper safety measures for
                    the previous six years, after having been confiscated by the Lebanese authorities from the abandoned ship MV Rhosus.
                    The explosion was preceded by a fire in the same warehouse, but as of September 2020, the exact cause of the detonation is still under investigation. "

                    Reading about this devasting explosion, I was curious to know how it affected the locals around the area.
                    The number of videos I watched about how it affected people and the result of the explosion, I was shocked by what happened.
                    I was curious to know what it would look like if that happened to my area. Since I started learning React.js and the ArcGIS API, I knew this would be a great concept to develop.

                <CalciteP>
                    The purpose of this application is to emulate the explosion radius from Beirut and let a user see what it would like with their area of interest.
                    I hope that this will inform people about how devasting the explosion was by viewing the explosion radius on a location they are intimate with.
